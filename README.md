## Requirements / Purpose

This project is a full-stack todo application designed to manage tasks and categories efficiently. The backend API supports CRUD operations with soft-deletion for tasks (archiving). The frontend provides an intuitive UI for managing, filtering, and organizing tasks.

### MVP Features

- Add, edit, and archive tasks  
- Categorize tasks with dynamic categories  
- Filter tasks by category  
- Duplicate tasks easily  
- Responsive UI with accessible form validation  

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript, SCSS Modules, FontAwesome for icons  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (assumed), PostgreSQL (or another DB)  
- **Why:** TypeScript for type safety, React for UI flexibility, REST API for modularity  

## Build Steps

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo.git
cd yourrepo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run backend server
## In the main folder
mvn spring-boot:run

# Run frontend
## In subfolders: frontend / todo_frontend 
npm start
```

### Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Design Goals / Approach
- Separation of Concerns: API handles data and logic, frontend manages UI
- Soft Delete: Archiving tasks instead of deleting them permanently
- User-Friendly UI: Completed tasks toggle for less visual clutter
- Extensible Structure: Categories stored separately to allow scalable filtering

## Features
âœ… Add, edit, archive/unarchive, and duplicate tasks

âœ… Add, update, delete categories

âœ… Filter tasks by category

âœ… Collapsible "Completed Tasks" section with animated chevron

âœ… Responsive layout with SCSS Modules

âœ… Basic client-side form validation

## Known Issues
ðŸš« No tests yet (will be added)

âš  Deleting a category doesnâ€™t warn about tasks linked to it

âš  Some layout quirks on very small screens

## Future Goals
âœ… Add automated tests (Jest + React Testing Library)

âœ… Improve mobile UI and responsiveness

âœ… Add user accounts and per-user task management

âœ… Sync tasks with external calendars or reminders

âœ… Improve keyboard accessibility and ARIA labels

## Change Logs
